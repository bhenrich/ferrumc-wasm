# Invariants: ferrumc-codec

> Rules that must hold for all code in this crate. Violating these is a bug.

## General

- No `unwrap()` or `expect()` outside `#[cfg(test)]`.
- No unbounded channels or allocations from untrusted input.
- All public items have rustdoc.
- Error types classify the failure mode.

## Crate-Specific

<!-- Add crate-specific invariants here as the code develops -->
